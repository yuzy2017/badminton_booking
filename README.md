This is an initial version of badminton booking script. It uses Chrome driver to login the website and simulite users click to finish booking.
As the restrict the total number of booking, I did not check if it can show advantage when booking an unreleased court, but for a exsist court, it can finish the job.
The processor of use is:
1. download the code and chromedriver.zip
2. change the chromedriver path and your nus id (nusstu\exxxxxxx) and your password. There are two sets of name and password need to be changed
3. try it once and debug a bit, it you do not like monday or the default time slot you can change it. Also, you can masage it a bit.
4. good luck, let's try if we can make it more convenient, I will check issues in two weeks.
